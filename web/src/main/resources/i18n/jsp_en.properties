page.history.title=Craps History
page.history1=Background about this complex dice gambling game 
page.history2=Long before online craps came about, the game was played by many different cultures around the world. Historians believe that craps actually originated in the Middle East and is a derivative of the Arabic name for dice which is "al-zahr". Going back as far as the 12th century, English crusaders in Jerusalem picked up on a dice game called al-zahr by the local population and brought it back to Europe where it became known as "hazard". They may have confused the Arabic name of the game for the word hazard because dice is a game of chance.
page.history3=Craps, known as hazard, reached many western European players and gained immense popularity in England and especially France. By the 18th century, French sailors bought the game of hazard with them to America via New Orleans and this is how it was introduced to North America. The rules of the game had changed slightly over the years and new terms were developed for different dice rolls. A dice roll of two was called crabs by the French sailors, but to spectators in New Orleans who were curious about the game, the word "crabs" sounded more like "craps" and that became the designated name of the game.
page.history4=Craps became well indoctrinated into the gambling scene in New Orleans and spread across America. With the rise of Las Vegas gambling establishments in the 20th century came the popularization of craps. Not only is it a popular casino game but craps is also played in the streets of many urban cities of North America. With the advent of the Internet, online craps has gained an even wider reach with fans of online gaming. Just about every good online casino features craps and online slots in its repertoire of games and there are many great software simulators available for playing free craps online. Try it out for yourself and see what all the hype is about. Good Luck!

page.rules.title=Craps Rules
page.rules1=Basic Rules to Play Craps
page.rules2=Online craps is a game that combines luck with smart betting strategy. Many people are curious about craps because it is a high-speed game with a lot of action and usually features a crowd of hooting players gathered around the casino table. Though the game may seem a bit complicated to learn, once you know the rules you'll be right in the heart of the action with everyone else.
page.rules3=To understand how online craps is played you need to know the terms used to play the game. Let's look at the most common terms used while playing. The Come Out Roll is where the action begins. It is the first roll in a new game of craps made by the shooter and it is also the first roll after the point has been established. The come out roll determines whether the shooter wins, loses or continues the game.
page.rules4=The marker (which looks like a puck) will let you know what stage the game is in. If the marker is black and shows "off" then the player has yet to make his point. If the marker is white, shows "on" and has been placed on a number, then that is the point, which the player has already established.
page.rules5=But even before the first roll is made, the bet must be established. The Pass Line bet is made by the player before the come out roll and pays even balance 1:1. You win right off the bat if you roll a 7 or 11 and you lose if you roll a 2, 3, or 12. All other numbers (4,5,6,8,9,10) simply establish the point, which allows the game to continue. From there the player is trying to roll his point number again before rolling a 7. If the 7 comes up first the shooter loses and if he rolls his point before rolling a 7 he wins.
page.rules6=The Don't Pass bet is kind of like the opposite of the Pass Line where the shooter wins on 2 or 3, ties on 12 and loses if he rolls either a 7 or 11. If the shooter rolls either 4,5,6,8,9,10 he establishes the point number and when playing the Don't Pass bet the hope is that the shooter will roll a 7 before he rolls his point number again. If he rolls a 7 first the Don't Pass bet wins and if he rolls his point number first the bet is lost.
page.rules7=The Come Bet is like the Pass line bet and it is placed after the shooter has made the Come Out roll. You place the come bet, the dice are rolled and the come bet then goes to the point number that was rolled which in effect becomes the number you are gambling on. It's an additional bet to the pass line and allows the player to cover more numbers. The Don't Come bet is the opposite of the come bet, this is placed after the come out roll and relies on the same rules as a Don't Pass bet.
page.rules8=The Odds Bets can be placed on either the Pass Line bet, the Don't Pass Line bet, the Come Bet as well as the Don't Come Bet. The point of the Odds bet is to backup the bet you already made and earn a higher payout on the win. The payout depends on the number being that is being wagered on.
page.rules9=If you wager on the Place Bets you are only betting on one of the following numbers being rolled before the 7: 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 10. Each number offers it's own craps odds. The Field Bet is another type of side bet that can be made in online craps at any time and pays the winner even balance when any of the following numbers are thrown: 3, 4, 9, 10 or 11. On the numbers 2 and 12 the player wins double balance. On numbers 5, 6, 7 or 8 the bet is lost.
